The RepSim toolbox is developed to perform Monte Carlo simulations of fMRI experiments. The resulting text file gives an idea of how likely it is, to have a false positive result repeated in j subjects out of a sample of N subjects.

The RepSim toolbox is created with the app designer in Matlab R2020b. The code to do the simulations is largely based and copied from the AlphaSim tool as implemented in RESTplus v1.24 (http://restfmri.net/forum/). In order to work, RESTplus and SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) should be installed.
